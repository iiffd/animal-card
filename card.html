			<p><em>If a philospher wanted to study the limpet, I think you can spend the rest of your life on the limpet. Fascinating creatures these limpets...The limpet has it's own universe inside the shell, and he's master of that domain. As some of the cultures of natives, they've found, they've mastered the art of doing nothing. Really they were efficient. They did what they needed to on a most base level to stay warm. They ate enough to keep from going, and they didn't burn that food energy up. When you look at life everything is energyâ€”we're energy. We're a ball of electric energy. But the limpet...oh, that's an efficent monster. Just go look at a limpet if you want to see a picture of an efficent use of energy. He just is. He is just totally zen, <strong>hooywoof</strong>, on the rock. Just take their rightful place there. </em></p>
